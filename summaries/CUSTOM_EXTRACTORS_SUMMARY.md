# Custom Domain Extractors for Outstanding Shares

## Overview

I've analyzed the URLs with errors in the outstanding shares updater and created custom extraction functions for domains with multiple URLs and high error rates. This implementation should significantly improve the success rate for extracting outstanding shares data.

## Analysis Results

Based on the error log analysis, I identified the following high-priority domains:

### Top Priority Domains (Multiple URLs + High Errors):
1. **valour.com** - 18 URLs with errors
2. **vaneck.com** - 13 URLs with errors  
3. **wisdomtree.eu** - 11 URLs with errors
4. **proshares.com** - 10 URLs with errors
5. **grayscale.com** - 10 URLs with errors
6. **lafv.li** - 10 URLs with errors
7. **augmentasicav.com** - 8 URLs with errors
8. **invesco.com** - 6 URLs with errors
9. **aminagroup.com** - 5 URLs with errors
10. **rexshares.com** - 5 URLs with errors

## Implementation

### 1. Custom Domain Extractors (`custom_domain_extractors.py`)

Created specialized extraction functions for each high-error domain:

- **`extract_valour_shares()`** - For valour.com URLs
- **`extract_vaneck_shares()`** - For vaneck.com URLs  
- **`extract_wisdomtree_shares()`** - For wisdomtree.eu URLs
- **`extract_proshares_shares()`** - For proshares.com URLs
- **`extract_grayscale_shares()`** - For grayscale.com URLs
- **`extract_lafv_shares()`** - For lafv.li URLs
- **`extract_augmenta_shares()`** - For augmentasicav.com URLs
- **`extract_invesco_shares()`** - For invesco.com URLs
- **`extract_aminagroup_shares()`** - For aminagroup.com URLs
- **`extract_rexshares_shares()`** - For rexshares.com URLs

Each function includes:
- Domain-specific CSS selectors
- Targeted element searches
- Regex patterns for shares extraction
- Error handling and logging
- Fallback mechanisms

### 2. Enhanced Outstanding Shares Updater (`enhanced_outstanding_shares_updater.py`)

Created an improved version of the main updater with:

#### Multi-tier Extraction Strategy:
1. **Custom Domain Extractors** (First priority)
2. **SIX Group Specialized Extractor** 
3. **Traditional Generic Extraction**
4. **AI Fallback with Groq**

#### Enhanced Reporting:
- Method-specific success tracking
- Detailed extraction statistics
- Improved error categorization
- Performance metrics by extraction method

### 3. Integration with Existing System

Modified the original `outstanding_shares_updater.py` to:
- Import custom domain extractors
- Use custom extractors before fallback methods
- Maintain backward compatibility

### 4. Testing Framework (`test_custom_extractors.py`)

Created a comprehensive test script to:
- Test each custom extractor with real URLs
- Measure success rates
- Identify areas for improvement
- Validate extraction accuracy

## Key Features

### Domain-Specific Optimization
Each custom extractor is tailored to the specific website structure and patterns of its target domain, including:
- Website-specific CSS selectors
- Domain-specific terminology (e.g., "anteile" for German sites)
- Common page layouts and data presentation formats

### Robust Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when custom extractors fail
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Automatic fallback to generic methods

### Performance Tracking
- Method-specific success statistics
- Domain-level error tracking
- Detailed reporting for optimization

## Expected Improvements

Based on the error analysis, implementing custom extractors for these 10 domains should address:
- **113 total error instances** across high-priority domains
- Approximately **30% of all current errors**
- Significant improvement in overall success rate

### Before Custom Extractors:
- Success rate: 38.77% (145/374 URLs)
- 229 failed extractions

### Expected After Custom Extractors:
- Estimated success rate: **55-65%** 
- Reduction of 50-80 failed extractions
- Better data quality and consistency

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Enhanced Updater:
```bash
python enhanced_outstanding_shares_updater.py
```

### Testing Custom Extractors:
```bash
python test_custom_extractors.py
```

### Using with Existing System:
The original `outstanding_shares_updater.py` has been updated to automatically use custom extractors when available.

## File Structure

```
├── custom_domain_extractors.py          # Custom extraction functions
├── enhanced_outstanding_shares_updater.py # Enhanced main updater
├── test_custom_extractors.py            # Testing framework
├── outstanding_shares_updater.py         # Updated original (with custom extractors)
├── analyze_domains.py                   # Domain analysis script
└── CUSTOM_EXTRACTORS_SUMMARY.md         # This documentation
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the custom extractors** with the test script
2. **Run the enhanced updater** on a subset of data
3. **Analyze results** and refine extractors as needed
4. **Deploy to production** once validated
5. **Monitor performance** and add more custom extractors for other domains

## Monitoring and Maintenance

The enhanced logging will help identify:
- Which custom extractors are most effective
- New domains that would benefit from custom extractors
- Changes in website structures that require extractor updates
- Overall system performance improvements

This implementation provides a scalable foundation for adding more custom extractors as new high-error domains are identified.
