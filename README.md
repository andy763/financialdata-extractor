## üìä Usage

### Extracting Stock Prices

```bash
python excel_stock_updater.py
```

This will:
- Load URLs from `data/Custodians.xlsx`
- Extract current stock prices from financial websites
- Update `data/Custodians_Results.xlsx` with the latest prices

### Extracting Outstanding Shares

```bash
python outstanding_shares_updater.py
```

This will:
- Load URLs from `data/Custodians.xlsx`
- Extract outstanding shares information
- Update `data/Custodians_Results.xlsx` with the shares data

### Using Batch Files

For Windows users, we provide batch files for easy execution:

```bash
# Run both extractors
batch_files/run_updater_with_shares.bat

# Run stock price extractor only
batch_files/run_updater.bat

# Run shares extractor only
batch_files/run_sixgroup_updater.bat
```

## üìÅ Data Structure

- **Input**: `data/Custodians.xlsx` - Main Excel file containing URLs to process
- **Output**: `data/Custodians_Results.xlsx` - Results file with extracted data
- **Excel Structure**:
  - **Column L**: Stock prices
  - **Column M**: Outstanding shares
  - **Column P**: Primary URLs for processing
  - **Column Q**: Fallback URLs (optional)

## ü§ñ AI Fallback System

When traditional web scraping methods fail, the system uses Groq's Llama 3.3 AI model to:

- Analyze webpage content intelligently
- Extract specific financial information like share prices and outstanding shares
- Distinguish between different types of financial metrics
- Handle various number formats and currencies
- Results from AI extraction are tagged with "(AI)" for transparency

## üõ†Ô∏è Supported Financial Platforms

The system supports extracting data from numerous financial platforms including:

- B√∂rse Frankfurt
- NASDAQ
- Euronext
- TMX
- BX Swiss
- London Stock Exchange
- CBOE US & AU
- VanEck
- Grayscale
- Valour
- WisdomTree
- ProShares
- And many more

## üß© Extending the System

### Adding Custom Extractors

To add support for a new financial website:

1. Create a custom extractor function in `src/custom_domain_extractors.py`
2. Register the extractor in the `DOMAIN_EXTRACTORS` dictionary
3. Follow existing extractors as examples for proper pattern matching

### Important Notes for Development

- Custom extractors must work for ALL URLs from a domain, not just specific test cases
- Use robust selectors and fallback mechanisms for maximum reliability
- Test thoroughly with multiple different URLs from the same domain
- Consider all possible page layouts and dynamic content
